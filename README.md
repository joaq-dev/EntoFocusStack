# Entomological Focus Stacking Dataset

This repository hosts data and resources supporting the development of a deep learning model for improved focus stacking in entomological 3D reconstruction. The dataset, designed to facilitate high-resolution, multi-focus image processing, is specifically curated for applications in the field of entomology. This README provides an overview of the dataset, related resources, and a link to the thesis detailing the model development and performance evaluation.

## Overview

Focus stacking is a computational photography technique used to increase the depth of field in images by combining several images taken at different focal distances. In the context of entomology, this technique is essential for achieving clear and detailed images of insect specimens, which are typically captured at extremely close distances. This dataset was created to support the development of a deep learning model designed to optimize focus stacking for 3D reconstruction of entomological specimens.

## Dataset

The **Entomological Focus Stacking Dataset** contains image bursts of insect specimens at varying focal distances. Each set of images provides a stack suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models for focus stacking.

- **Format**: High-resolution JPEG images.
- **Data Volume**: Multiple stacks per specimen, with varying depths and object distances.
- **Resolution**: Consistent high-resolution images ideal for deep learning applications.
